Friday the 13th or Black Friday is considered as unlucky day.

Write a function `countUnluckyDays` that takes an integer `year` and calculates
how many unlucky days are in the given year.

Return the total number of Black Fridays in the year as an integer (all `year <= 0`
are considered years BC and also have unlucky days).

Examples:

```javascript
countUnluckyDays(1) === 2; // Two Black Fridays in the year 1
countUnluckyDays(-3) === 1; // One Black Friday in the year -3
countUnluckyDays(2015) === 3; // Three Black Fridays in the year 2015
```
