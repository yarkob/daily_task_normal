Write a function `findStray` that accepts an array of numbers `nums`, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number, and returns that single different number.

The input array will always be valid (the minimum array length is `3`).

Examples:

```javascript
findStray([1, 1, 2]) === 2;
findStray([17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17]) === 3;
findStray([-1, -1, 1, -1]) === 1;
```
