Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is known for his special style on Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he almost always capitalizes every word.
Let's write a function `toJadenCase` that converts strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith.

Note: the string may contain spaces at the beginning, at the end or several in a row!

Examples:

```javascript
toJadenCase('i watch twilight every night') === 'I Watch Twilight Every Night';
toJadenCase('Trees are never Sad') === 'Trees Are Never Sad';
toJadenCase('  no   more words') === 'No More Words';
```
