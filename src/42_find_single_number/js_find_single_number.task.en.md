Write a function `findSingleNum` that accepts a non-empty array of integers `nums`.

Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

Find and return that single one.

Examples:

```js
findSingleNum([1]) === 1;
findSingleNum([3, 3, 2]) === 2;
findSingleNum([4, 1, 2, 1, 2]) === 4;
```
