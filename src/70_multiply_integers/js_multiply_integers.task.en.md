Write a function `multiplyNums` that accepts an array of positive integers `nums`.

In the array `nums` every element appears three times, except one that appears only once (let's call it `x`) and one that appears only twice (let's call it `y`).

Your task is to find `x * x * y`.

Examples:

```javascript
multiplyNums([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]) === 18; // 3 x 3 x 2 = 18
multiplyNums([6, 5, 4, 10, 6, 5, 4, 10, 6, 5, 4, 20]) === 4000; // 20 x 20 x 10 = 4000
```
