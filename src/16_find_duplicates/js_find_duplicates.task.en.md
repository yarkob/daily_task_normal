Write a function `findDuplicates` that accepts an array of integers `nums` consisting of positives, negatives and zeros.

Find the duplicates in array, and return a new array of those duplicates. The elements of the returned array should appear in the order when they first appeared as duplicates.

Examples:

```js
findDuplicates([0, 1, 2, 3]) === [];
findDuplicates([-1, 0, 3, 5, 0, 3, 3, -1]) === [0, 3, -1];
```
