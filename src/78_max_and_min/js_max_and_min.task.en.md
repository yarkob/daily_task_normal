Write a function `maxAndMin` that accepts a string of space separated numbers and returns the biggest and the smallest number. Result must be a string with two numbers separated by a single space, and the biggest number goes first.

There will always be at least one number in the input string. The input string may contain spaces at the beginning, at the end or several spaces in a row.

```javascript
maxAndMin('1 2 3 4 5'); // '5 1'
maxAndMin('1 9 3 4 -5'); // '9 -5'
maxAndMin('2'); // '2 2'
```
